# MicrocontrollerWork
Many of my microcontroller projects for school and otherwise are here. It is mostly for STM32 boards using HAL drivers.
Each folder is a separate project. Each project contains a ReadMe.txt file which contains a brief synopsis of the project.
Some of the folders have reports (.PDF files) from the class the projects were for as well, which go into more detail on experimental setup and results.
